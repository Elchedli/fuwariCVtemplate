❌ Current Behavior
When a user clicks on an open image within the carousel:
It closes the carousel view (lightbox/modal) entirely.
It fails to perform the expected action (upscaling/zooming the image).

🎨 Missing Transition
The images in this carousel lack the expected animation (specifically the "zoom transition" often associated with PhotoSwipe), resulting in a sudden, static display change instead of a fluid transition, which contrasts with the correct behavior seen in layout.astro.
