**work analysis**
0. course of indyDevDan and recheck the video about skills (50 minutes and other videos after the course). course -> skills video 50 minutes -> other videos to learn more.

**check errors**
1. ESLINT(biome **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kwmIaPty8** instead since it's better, learn how to use it instead of ESLINT) make your own configuration (conditions for the project) so before it stops it see if it respected your configuration and see if there is errors (idk if typescript errors can be readed but it should check that too). check if build errors are better than typescript errors for checking.
2. Unit test/functional tests to see if everything works it finishes.
**Skills**
1. do templates snippets and understand the core thing about skills. make a alias for git and snippets vscode prompt engineering.
2. make a skill generator that make a concise clear example of what it needs using *tools*.
3. learn. learn. learn. optimize. learn.

**hallucinate less**
1. read original docs don't change anything about it, see how to scrape the documentation and use it (indydev video) instead of ai try to sideguess certain librairies -- skills video are good for that and one video he explains how he extract docs optimized to use it effectively.


**Workflow to understand projects**
1. so start optimized interesting open source projects and try to understand them as fast as you can, use breakpoints and senior methods to be able to deduct how the project work
2. use ai tools and make components graphs and create skills that extract the important parts, see courses or videos explaining how to do that effectively.


**local LLM**
- Use claude CLI with deepseek local and see if it's coding better and resolve things better than gemini whatever or code whatever.
