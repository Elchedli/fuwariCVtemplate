## Alternative Minimal Version:
```text
Fix image carousel by modifying ONLY @ImageCarousel.svelte. 
Check: 1) Props from rehype component, 2) Svelte lifecycle, 3) Event handlers. 
Only add to @Layout.astro if absolutely necessary. Be specific about the exact changes needed.
```

**Key improvements from your original:**
- Clear separation of modifiable vs non-modifiable files
- Specific technical areas to investigate
- Focus on integration points
- Action-oriented output request
- Maintains your constraint boundaries
