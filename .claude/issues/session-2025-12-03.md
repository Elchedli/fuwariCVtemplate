# Session Log - 2025-12-03

## Active Issue
**Goal:** Create a Rehype plugin/MDX solution to render `::carousel` blocks as an interactive carousel component with Swup compatibility.

## Log
### [2025-12-03] Prompt Processing
- **Understood:** Create a `::carousel` directive handler that renders a Swup-compatible image carousel using Svelte, ensuring standard images remain unchanged.
- **Resolved:**
  - Created `src/components/ImageCarousel.svelte` (Svelte 5 component with controls and caption).
  - Created `src/plugins/rehype-component-carousel.mjs` to transform `::carousel` into a placeholder with JSON data.
  - Registered the new plugin in `astro.config.mjs`.
  - Added hydration script to `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to mount the Svelte component on load and Swup navigation.
  - **Fix:** Uncommented `site` in `astro.config.mjs` to resolve a build error caused by `@astrojs/sitemap` requiring a site URL (which was previously commented out).

### [2025-12-03] Follow-up Processing
- **Understood:** Revise the carousel component to match specific interaction requirements: click-to-advance (no separate controls), full image visibility, and caption at the bottom.
- **Resolved:**
  - Modified `src/components/ImageCarousel.svelte`:
    - Removed previous/next buttons and dot indicators.
    - Implemented click-to-advance logic on the main image container.
    - Enhanced styles for clearer image presentation and caption positioning.

### [2025-12-03] Follow-up Processing (Modal Carousel)
- **Understood:** Upgrade the carousel to a Modal Image Carousel.
    - Initial view: First image inline, clickable.
    - Modal view: Fullscreen, thumbnails, nav controls, caption.
    - Requirements: `:::carousel` support, Portal for modal, Swup cleanup.
- **Resolved:**
  - Rewrote `src/components/ImageCarousel.svelte`:
    - Implemented `portal` action to move modal to `document.body`.
    - Created inline trigger showing the first image with a visual cue.
    - Implemented full-screen modal with backdrop, close button, nav arrows.
    - Added thumbnail strip with scroll-into-view logic.
    - Added keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Escape).
    - Added `transition:fade` for smooth open/close/slide.
  - Verified `rehype-component-carousel.mjs` is compatible with `:::carousel` container directive via recursive `visit`.
  - **Bug Fix:** Addressed "image not rendering" issue caused by path resolution.
    - Modified `src/plugins/rehype-component-carousel.mjs` to render children in a hidden `div` instead of stringifying to JSON, ensuring Astro processes relative paths and bundles assets.
    - Updated `src/layouts/Layout.astro` hydration script to read resolved `src` from the DOM images.
  - **Bug Fix:** Addressed build error regarding missing `link` class in `@apply` within `src/styles/markdown.css`. Removed the invalid class reference.
