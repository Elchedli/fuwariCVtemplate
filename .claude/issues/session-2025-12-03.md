## Active Issue
**Goal:** Create a Rehype plugin/MDX solution to render `::carousel` blocks as an interactive carousel component with Swup compatibility.

## Log
### [2025-12-03] Prompt Processing
- **Understood:** Create a `::carousel` directive handler that renders a Swup-compatible image carousel using Svelte, ensuring standard images remain unchanged.
- **Resolved:**
  - Created `src/components/ImageCarousel.svelte` (Svelte 5 component with controls and caption).
  - Created `src/plugins/rehype-component-carousel.mjs` to transform `::carousel` into a placeholder with JSON data.
  - Registered the new plugin in `astro.config.mjs`.
  - Added hydration script to `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to mount the Svelte component on load and Swup navigation.
  - **Fix:** Uncommented `site` in `astro.config.mjs` to resolve a build error caused by `@astrojs/sitemap` requiring a site URL (which was previously commented out).
